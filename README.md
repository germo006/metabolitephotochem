# metabolitephotochem
Welcome! This is the repository for the code that I used to assess metabolite degradation rates under a solar simulator. 

## A Brief Set of Notes
Hello there! If you're viewing this repository, well, it's a work in progress. I'm still in the process of making it self-consistent, as currently the code here reflects the state of analysis while I'm still toying with overly ambitious ideas. 
-There is data here that I use for things that won't be in the final paper, as well as accompanying scripts and functions.
-Since this is a code repository, the larger data files are _not here._
